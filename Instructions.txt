*** MAKE SURE NOT TO PUSH ANY IRRELEVANT FILES LIKE .classpath, etc ***

Environment Setup:

1. Download Java 8 (JDK 1.8) **Any newer Java version will work***
 	Link: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
2. Download Newest version of Eclipse (2019-12)
	Link: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/2019-12/R/eclipse-inst-win64.exe
3. Install JavaFx by going on Help => Eclipse Marketplace => Search javafx => Downlaod e(fx)clipse 3.6.0
4. Download SceneBuilder 
	Link: https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/
5. SET THE LOCATION OF THE SCENEBUILDER (MAKE SURE TO DO THIS)...
	Go to Window => Preferences => JavaFX => Change Location of SceneBuilder executable to whichever directory
	 you stored the application.
6. git clone https://github.com/pranshupatel/FileRenamer.git
7. Open file on Eclipse and you're ready to go


How to Use SceneBuilder:

1. Open SceneBuilder (make sure the location of it was set check above).
2. Go to File => Open and open Main.fxml from FileRenamer repo
3. Add any layouts, etc and save. Eclipse will auto updated Main.fxml file
4. If you want buttons or any other controls to have actions, highlight them,
go in the "Properties" tab on right, and name the control id accordingly (with proper format like "btnSelect").
5. After naming them, add a method in "MainController" class that will perform the action. Set the "OnAction"
menu tab to the corresponding method in the "Code" section of button.
6. Add the control as an attribute/variable (same name as id) for MainController class 
and make sure you put @FXML on top (see class).


Add Ons in Order:

BUG: Currently it is not possible to highlight/select files from multiple different directories in the FileChooser. The 
code is fine, its just the FileChooser doesnt allow you to select multiple directory files

1. Make the Preview editable.
2. Provide an option to relocate all renamed files to a specific folder.
3. Add more labelling options (such as months, years, etc).
4. Add indexs to the labelling options which allows users to further modify the formatting
(such as starting numbers from 10 instead of 1)
